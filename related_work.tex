\chapter{Related Work}
In this chapter we present work related to this thesis. In section 3.1, we descibe alternatives to Gazebo and why we choose Gazebo. In section 3.2, we give an overview of other popular simulations, especially a simulation that also uses Gazebo and other multi-robot simulations, and in section 3.3, we describe our current multi-robot strategy as well as other attractive strategies our simulation should be able to evaluate. In the following, we will use the terms \textit{multi-robot} and \textit{multi-agent} interchangeably because the common term in litrature is multi-agent and we want to use multi-robot. A multi-agent system can consist of fully abstract agents, such as \textcolor{red}{...}, whereas we are dealing with multi-robot system and therefore robots that interact physically with their environment.
