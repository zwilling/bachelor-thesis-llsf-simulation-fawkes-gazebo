\section{Introduction}

Multi-robot systems are combinations of multiple robots that are made to work together on specific tasks. Currently, they are mostly used in assembly lines, where many robot-arms simultaneously do repetitive tasks with the same object. More autonomous examples of multi-robot systems can be found in the warehousing domain. Here, many robots bring demanded goods and store new ones \cite{Kiva}. The major advantages of multi-robot systems are high flexibility and the possibility to run different tasks in parallel. The amount of possible applications is large. They also can play soccer \cite{mas_soccer}, There are plans to use multiple robots with different abilities in planetary exploration \textcolor{red}{cite}, rescue scenarios \cite{mas_rescue}
Though, there are very few multi-robot systems by now.
