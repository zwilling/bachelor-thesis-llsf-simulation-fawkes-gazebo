\chapter{Summery and Future Work}
\label{cha:summery_and_future_work}
In this chapter, we show possible future work on the simulation and our multi-robot system for LLSF in section~\ref{sec:future_work}. Afterwards, we conclude the thesis in section~\ref{sec:summery}.

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}
In the near future, the simulation and the multi-robot system solution for LLSF need to be changed because LLSF is going to be changed. At the RoboCup 2014 it is likely that two teams play at the same time on the same field with double size. The machines with RFID-readers might also get replaced by small assembly machines. This also demands hardware changes on the Robotino, such as a new gripper. The simulation has to be adapted to these changes.\\



low level reliability, navigation coordination
locking workaround
grundstein methoden, andere felder
low level reliability necessary
refactor gazebo plugins/split in more plugins for each sensor, actuator

\section{Summery}
\label{sec:summery}

\textcolor{red}{seitenzahlen komisch angeordnet}
low level reliability necessary
use in several current developments (hackathon, wecam, colli)
