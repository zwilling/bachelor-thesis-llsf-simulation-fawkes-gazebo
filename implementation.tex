\chapter{Implementation}
In this chapter, we describe how we implemented the simulation. First, section 5.1 presents the various modules we developed by describing what their task is, what we noticed during the implementation and why we implemented it this way. \textcolor{red}{module dependencies extra or in modules?} In section~\ref{sec:module_dependencies}, we describe the dependencies and interaction between the modules we developed. Section 5.3 covers the implementation of the communication between Fawkes and Gazebo and between multiple robots we want to simulate. In section 5.4, we present the improvements for the multi-agent system we implemented during the thesis.
